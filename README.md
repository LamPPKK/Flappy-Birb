# Flappy-Birb
An SDL2/C++ version of the famous game by DotGEARS Studio!

I started learning SDL2, and the first thing I wanted to make was a C++ version of Flappy Birb, and here it is!
The folder "release" contains an already compiled Microsoft 64-bit version, so you just have to download it, and play!

**_Requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable!_**

A short video about it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMDtpBzaUdM

Note:
I made this game in 5 days, do not expect it to be perfect, the window is not resizable, and although the game experience might be very similar, the source code is not very clean (I usually do not code like that, this was more like a "test" for my current SDL2 skills).

Hope you like it!
